Wrecked

Days pass by and my eyes stay dry and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?
 
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day
 
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck
 
They say that the time will heal and the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh and your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?
 
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day
 
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
 
These days when I'm on the brink of the edge
I remember the words that you said
"Remember the life you led"
You'd say, "Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud
